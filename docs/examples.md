# Examples

Here are two templates that should produce same result but with different ppi. There are some differences in the layout due to not specifying every element in the CSS. Some of them have the default values that do not scale with the rem unit.

These examples are intentionally made this way to show the effects of different ppi settings. You can use these as a starting point for your own templates.
